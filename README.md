<b>About</b>


Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images.
This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of
semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. 
With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, 
security, and marketing.
